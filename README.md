# cmi-flask
My first web application developed with Flask as part of a second-year programming project.

This project consists of three separate sections. The first two sections are merely exercises, the point of which was to get a feel for the Flask environment. The third section consists of an analysis of the results of about 1,500 first-year students in a standardised IT test, PIX, similar to the C2I certificate, which it is intended to replace. This section is called "Analyse PIX".

The third section features some numerical analysis as well as graphs generated in JavaScript using the D3 library (v4).

Project is currently live at https://tbaranger.pythonanywhere.com
